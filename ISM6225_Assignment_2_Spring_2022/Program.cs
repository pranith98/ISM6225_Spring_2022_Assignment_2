        Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.
        The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

        Explanation: "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word. "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
        Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive, that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

             •	result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.
 
        Example 1:

        Output: [3,60]
        Explanation: You can write s as follows:
                     abcdefghij  	 // 100 pixels wide
                     klmnopqrst  	 // 100 pixels wide

                     There are a total of 3 lines, and the last line is 60 pixels wide.

         s = "bbbcccdddaaa"
         Output: [2,4]
         Explanation: You can write s as follows:
                      bbbcccdddaa  	  // 98 pixels wide
                      a           	 // 4 pixels wide

        International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:

        •	'b' maps to "-...",
        •	'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.

        For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
        [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
